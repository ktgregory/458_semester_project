    <br>
    added the "what this does" alerts on the "Cards" and "Create" pages
    <br>

    <br>
    created the database
    <br>
    added functionality to the create/edit select pages
    <br>
    added function to create new stack and add cards to them

    Katie did the following: made auth and card providers; 
    added functionality to login page and sign up page; 
    added functionality to select stacks (view) page 
    (dynamically list stacks that a user has made);
    added functionality to cards page - populated page with 
    cards from database, added front-back side toggle and 
    ability to click through cards
  </p>

  <p>
    Together: "About" (Katie - original design, Dylan - revision)
    <br>
    navigation (we did the original navigation seperately for our individual pages, then sat down together and revised them)
    <br>
    layout and color (Dylan did the original layout, Katie revised - Katie did the original coloring, Dylan revised)

    <br>
    View Cards (Center Heading, update buttons)
    <br>
    Create/Edit (update buttons)
    <br>
    Home (center heading)
    <br>
